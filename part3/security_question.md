Using the 2021 OWASP Top 10 as a guide, here are the security measures we would implement for our solar panel installation app:

**1. A01:2021-Broken Access Control:**
   - Enforce proper access controls, limiting user privileges. Users should only have access to the resources they need.
   - Implement secure session management for both mobile and web platforms.

**2. A02:2021-Cryptographic Failures:**
   - Utilize strong, adaptive, and salted hashing algorithms for sensitive data.
   - Ensure that data in transit is encrypted using protocols like TLS.

**3. A03:2021-Injection:**
   - Sanitize all user inputs to prevent SQL injection, especially in interactions with the MySQL database.
   - Validate and sanitize data inputs to prevent other forms of injection attacks, such as command injection or NoSQL injection.

**4. A04:2021-Insecure Design:**
   - Regularly review system design, perform threat modeling exercises.
   - Strengthen authentication and authorization mechanisms.

**5. A05:2021-Security Misconfiguration:**
   - Regularly audit AWS and Kubernetes configurations to prevent misconfigurations.
   - Restrict public access to sensitive resources using AWS Security Groups and Network Policies.

**6. A06:2021-Vulnerable and Outdated Components:**
   - Use tools to scan for vulnerabilities in dependencies.
   - Keep all components and dependencies up-to-date, patch known vulnerabilities promptly.

**7. A07:2021-Identification and Authentication Failures:**
   - Implement strong authentication, consider multi-factor authentication.
   - Regularly update authentication protocols to meet industry standards.

**8. A08:2021-Software and Data Integrity Failures:**
   - Ensure data integrity during transit and at rest.
   - Implement checksums and digital signatures for critical data.

**9. A09:2021-Security Logging and Monitoring Failures:**
   - Implement comprehensive logging for user actions and system events.
   - Set up monitoring and alerts to detect and respond to suspicious activities.

**10. A10:2021-Server-Side Request Forgery:**
    - Validate and sanitize user-supplied URLs to prevent server-side request forgery attacks.
    - Implement strict access controls to prevent unauthorized access to internal resources.

Additionally, foster a strong security culture within the organization through regular employee training, periodic security audits, and an incident response plan for potential breaches.
